# DealwithNonUniqueRowNames
This repository contains a pipeline for processing single-cell RNA-seq data in bioinformatics research,includes steps to automatically process multiple datasets, aggregate gene expression data by unique gene prefixes, and create Seurat objects for downstream analysis.

# Notation
You need to read 10X data and create data-objects first, then put them into a list so that the FOR can deal with them one by one.
